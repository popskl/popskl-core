# PoPskl

Proof of Presence done right

# Terminal-based Demo

- The real application would have the QR code visible on some screen at the point of sale
- the user would open popskl.com to see something like a "pop it!" button that opens a camera view
- once the user device reads the QR code, they are either
  - (a) prompted with confirmation of their pop (because the page just calls the contract automatically once a valid QR code is detected)
  - (b) prompted to login to NEAR wallet
  - (c) setup a NEAR account if they don't already have one
