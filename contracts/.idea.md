# PoPskl

Proof of Presence done right

# Demo

# Design Sketch

- in a world where someone controls a physical space (eg. a store)

- you want to establish Proof of Presence in that place and at that time
- they want to establish your identity (eg. loyalty points)

- you have an account on chain
- they have an account on chain with the popskl contract deployed

- they have a POS device that renders some data that you can use to close the PoP loop

---

scenario

1. you step up to the counter and pull out your phone
2. you launch the guest view
3. you point it at the PoP QR Code
4. the reader sends that data back to the PoP contract as proof
5. the contract captures that data, along with your account, and updates it's internal state
6. the reader signals success and the PoP QR Code changes immediately (as a kind of confirmation)
